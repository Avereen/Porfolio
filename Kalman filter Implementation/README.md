# Kalman filter Implementation
This work was done for a paper on high-rate state estimation. This is a small piece of the code used in an upcoming work in data fusion. The work focuses on solving for the vibrational modes of a structure quicker than typically allowed by using generalized eigenvalue solvers with the FEA description of the structure to solve for those modes. Using a method termed localized eigenvalue modification procedure, the mode shapes are solved from a singular structural dynamic modification to the fea model in modal space, which retrieves the updated eigenvalues of the new structure in O(n) time complexity, where N is the size of the mesh.
