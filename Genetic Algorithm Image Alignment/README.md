# GA image alignment
This genetic algorithm implementation is intended to align images so that only the difference between them remains. This was developed for profilometer height map images where scale, skew, and translation were of concern in the imported images. This multi-parameter optimization problem was developed using a genetic algorithm to explore the parameters effectively. The 64-bit parameterized string denotes regions for skew,  translation X and Y, and zoom, effectively spanning our given problem space. The entire implementation uses the standard SciPy,  NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries. The included code in file use a toy box version of the problem to solve for the known minimal error as a proof of concept this was used in an upcoming paper “Validation of Large Area Capacitive Sensors for Impact Damage Assessment”.
